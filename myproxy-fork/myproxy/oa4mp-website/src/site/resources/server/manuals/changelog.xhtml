    <li>OAUTH-162: Client secret must be sent on access token request but not on authorization request.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-163: State must be returned in OAuth 2 component with authorization response callback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.2.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-127: MyProxyLogon website updated to point to current release.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-129: Sorting entries with the the CLI <b>ls</b> command. Before there was no sorting,
        now it is done by client ID or date, where applicable.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-134: Updating documentation on how to run a monitor.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-154: Removed possible redundant/conflicting maven dependencies.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-156: Turn off default logging for MyProxyLogon. This permits use of the MyProxyLogon
    module as a library without getting logging messages to the console (the previous default).</li>
    <li>OAUTH-157: Client registration page not saving client secret under OAuth 1.0a protocol.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-158: Updated links on generic client registration page to current documentation.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-159: Update documentation for this release.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-160: Regularize and improve version reporting at component (CLI, client, server) startup.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-131: Improved client registration for OAuth 2 servers. </li>
    <li>OAUTH-149: Remove support for MyProxyLogon to use SSL version 3. (This mitigates the POODLE attack.)</li>
    <li>OAUTH-152: Do not show detailed MyProxy error message if authorization fails.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-153: Improved logging for MyProxy errors and successes.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-155: Updated documentation to explain new OAuth 2 client registration process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.1.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-139: CLI might return an incorrect list of items after several updates.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-140: MyProxy component didn't quite log completely to the configured log file.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-141: Improved client/server walkthough. This is documentation that permits an administrator
        to deploy both a client and server locally with a self-signed cert for testing purposes.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-143: Enabling the Globus DN option should have had better documentation pointing at the
        server requirements for JGlobus.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-144: Jetty version was incorrect, causing certain build issues. This was standardized on version
        6.1.26 to ensure consistent builds.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-147: Potential cleanup thread failure with a filestore. If a filestore is used and one of the
        files is corrupted (e.g. due to a system crash at the time of writing it) then the cleanup thread
        would fail to start. Now such corrupted files are simply logged in catalina.out and ignored otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-148: Maria DB support added.</li>

</ul>

<h2>1.1.2</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-112: Servlet initialization is injected now, decoupling it more from Tomcat startup.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-113: MyProxy does not handle PAM challenges. The documentation has been updated with a link to the
        appropriate page
        on the MyProxy website where this is discussed.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-117: Server install walkthrough updated and improved to reflect changes (in particular, it now makes us of
        the resolution of OAUTH-110).
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-118. Build error in maven caused OAuth2 command line tools to issue an NPE in certain cases.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-119: Loading objects into the CLI that do not have identifiers caused an NPE. This could only arise really
        if someone directly edited an entry in a text editor (e.g. if the installation was backed by a filestore). In
        that
        case it would not be possible to load any objects from that store into the CLI, preventing editing of them.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-120: The new <b>-component</b> flag allows an administrator to start the CLI with the named component as
        an
        argument. E.g. rather than start the CLI and use the approval component, just issue<br/>
        <code>./oa4mp-cli -component approvals<br/></code>
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-125: "About" and "Overview" links on website were broken.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-126: Website now lists the version number with the "latest" link.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-130: Documentation amended to clarify which version of OA4MP (based on OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0)
        to use.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-133: Configuration option to convert standard DN to (legacy) Globus identifiers. This is mostly
        useful for installations that have been using Globus for a very long time.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-135: Failure in authentication were not displaying the correct message. They should route the user
        back to the login page for another attempt.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>1.1.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-105:Added support for file includes to configuration files.</li>
    <li>OAUTH-105: Added checks to prevent cycles in aliases and files</li>
    <li>OAUTH-106: Adding fully qualified host name to client approval notifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>OAUTH-47 Now supports building with maven 3.0+ There was an issue with earlier an pom version
        that prevented this.
    </li>
    <li>Support for OAuth 2 protocol. This includes full server and client support as well as
        various supported stores (mysql, postgres, files) and admin tools.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-94: Fix for passthrough of Shibboleth attributes.
        A <a href="server/manuals/Username-transformations.xhtml">username transformation</a> interface has been
        created.
        This will be invoked immediately before the call to MyProxy.
        Users that wish to customize this may do so by implementing the interface and setting it in the environment
        at server startup.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-96: Check for a bad PKCS10 CSR (missing version number which must be set to 0) created by pyOpenSSL is
        now in place and an informative message is now
        issued. Earlier the Bouncy Castle code allowed for this, Sun does not.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-99: Old documentation at Science Gateway Security site removed. Everything is redirected to this site
        now.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-102: No username returned with cert in certain cases. Fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.0.7</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added support to make using log 4j optional. It had been disabled which interfered with some installations.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug OAUTH-90.</li>
    <li>Fixed bug OAUTH-94. This adds a configuration option to
        <a href="server/configuration/authorization-header.xhtml">return the DN</a> of the user's cert as the username.
    </li>
    <li>All new command line tools that allow for managing clients and approvals.</li>
    <li>Changed client index page to be more up to date.</li>
    <li><b>Removed</b> all explicit references to Bouncy Castle. This should prevent future jar pollution from
        incompatible versions. JGlobus still uses this though....<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Set mysql and postgres jars to be provided rather than included in the release so that projects that
        need only a single type of storage are not required to install both of these.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>1.0.6</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Version number is now printed to the console whenever the server starts up.</li>
    <li>Support for authentication using the REMOTE_USER (or any other) header.</li>
    <li>Improved error handling on the server, especially in cases where the MyProxyLogon client encounters a runtime
        exception.
    </li>
    <li>OAUTH-80: errors resulting from JGlobus broken build will be resolved by their conforming to standard maven
        practices
    </li>
    <li>Fix for OAUTH-83 documentation error in configuring mail addresses</li>
    <li>OAUTH-84 failure to return a complete certificate chain from MyProxy in a certain case</li>
    <li>OAUTH-85 failure to configure logging could result in an error. Default is to dump everything into the tomcat
        logs.
    </li>
    <li>Use of new JGlobus release 2.0.5.</li>
    <li>Bouncy Castle version set to 1.43 to support JGlobus release 2.0.5.</li>
    <li>Added signatures for the lastest downloadable war.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1.0.5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Support for limited proxy generation. Allows the server to generate a public/private keypair and issue a limited
        proxy. The result is a certificate chain.
    </li>
    <li>Deny HTTP header. This sets the HTTP header to "deny" which prevents clickjacking attacks.</li>
    <li>Added logging support. Standard Java logging is now available and configurable.</li>
    <li>Default MyProxy server on localhost. If no MyProxy server is specified, one is assumed to be running on
        localhost.
    </li>
    <li>Improved admin tools. In particular, improved the CLI to give more readable messages.</li>
    <li>Improved SQL install scripts.</li>
    <li>Links in the documentation to the latest versions of these scripts.</li>
    <li>More and better documentation.</li>
</ul>
