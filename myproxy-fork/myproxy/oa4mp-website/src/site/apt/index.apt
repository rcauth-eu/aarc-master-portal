OAuth for MyProxy

    OAuth for MyProxy provides an OAuth-compliant REST web interface to the MyProxy service
    for providing user certificates to science gateways. It eliminates the need for users to disclose their MyProxy
    passwords to science gateways. Instead, gateway users authenticate to their MyProxy server's OAuth web interface to
    approve issuance of a certificate by MyProxy to the science gateway they are using.

    OAuth for MyProxy now support a subset of the OAuth2.0 protocol based on Open ID Connect. Since OA4MP is
    written to its own abstraction layer, most of the differences in implementation between the versions of
    OAuth are hidden from you. You really don't need to know too much about them. As such, any OAuth 2 specific
    features will be clearly noted.
