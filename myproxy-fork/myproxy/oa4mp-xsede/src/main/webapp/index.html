        Welcome to XSEDE's MyProxy delegation page!
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
        This page simply contains information about the XSEDE project's MyProxy delegation service.
        To access the functionality, you will need a gateway and a login on MyProxy.
        There is not much a user can do directly with this site. This page is aimed at portal and gateway developers.
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        This service allows a user to request a certificate from MyProxy for use by a gateway. This is
        based on the <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/">OAuth for MyProxy</a>
        code base. In that documentation, a gateway will be using the client code.
        When a gateway needs a certificate to do something on a user's behalf, it initiates a request to this site.
        The user authorizes this at this portal ( not the gateway which would be insecure).
        The certificate is then obtained and returned to the gateway.

        <h2>How does it do it?</h2>
        Magic. Well, not quite. You can read the
        <A href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1BJBG92yJULLNAVixBDqyq48ohpMZ9ToGHP9qKWSSGcE">specification</a>
        for
        all the <a href="http://security.ncsa.illinois.edu/teragrid-oauth/">gory details</a> (and there are a lot of them, I might add). Suffice to say it is nontrivial.

        <H3>Gateway sources</h3>
        If you are looking to set up a gateway, then you should read up
        <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/client/index.xhtml">how to set up an OAuth for MyProxy client</a>
        on how to get the sources, build them (if needed) and incorporate them into your gateway. The details are put
        into a
        very simple service API
        so adding this functionality to your gateway should be quite straightforward -- that is the aim.
        <h3>Gateway registration</h3>

        To <a href="https://oa4mp.xsede.org/oauth/register">register</a> your gateway with a portal, be sure to look at
        <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/client/manuals/registering-with-a-server.xhtml">Registering
            A Gateway</a>
        which describes how to do this.
        <h3>Portal sources</h3>
        Finally, there is
        <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/client/manuals/getting-started.xhtml">Getting
            Started</a>
        which details how to get, build and deploy a portal to do MyProxy delegation.
