This blurb tells how to roll and deploy the myproxy logon website.

* Build the myproxy-logon client running mvn clean install.

* Copy the resulting MyProxyLogon.jar from the target directory of the previous step to the src/site directory.

* tar up the src/site directory

* transfer it (e.g. with scp) to the target server (currently this is pkilab2.ncsa.uiuc.edu)

* Make sure you issue kinit and aklog on pkilab2 before trying to do anything or you will get all
  sorts of permissions errors on afs.

* Untar it into the  target directory (currently /afs/ncsa.uiuc.edu/web/grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htdocs/myproxy/MyProxyLogon/)

* Check that the site comes up and that the MyProxyLogon.jar works right.
